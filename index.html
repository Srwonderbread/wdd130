    Welcome to Ryan Lavin's Index Page
    <p>
      My name is Ryan Lavin, I am a Computer Science major and I would like to
      focus more on <strong>data security</strong> when it comes to my degree because computer
      science can mean a lot of things. I expect to understand basics of web
      development for insight into the flaws and vulnerabilities that are
      possible within web pages. I’m from <em>Carlsbad California.</em> I am a big fan of
      computer science and coding but outside of that I love cooking and playing
      video games with my friends. I’m always altering recipes I try over and
      over again until I get the taste I love and a recipe I’ll keep.
